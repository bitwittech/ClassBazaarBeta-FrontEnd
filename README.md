# Hey, happy to have you here, Welcome to ClassBazaar.

## First thing first so, what is ClassBazaar?

### <a href = 'https://www.classbazaar.com'>Class Bazaar</a>  is a search engine and reviews website for massive open online courses (MOOCs). Class Bazaar aggregates thousands of courses from multiple providers so that you find the best courses on almost any subject, wherever they may exist. Our catalog has 1,50,000+ courses from worldâ€™s leading universities and organizations.

## We are a Learner Supported Community 

#### Class Bazaar is a learner supported community and we make money through affiliate marketing links. Basically, we may earn a commission when someone clicks through to a course provider and does a paid course or a certificate. For a major portion of our catalog we do NOT have any affiliate partnerships and do not stand to earn a commission however those courses are still very relevant in their respective domains so we show them in search results. We NEVER let the affiliate relationship influence the course listing.The most important thing for us is that you fast track your search of any MOOCs.

## Our Team
#### We are a small team currently working in roles of the business which we have never done before. However, we share a common passion for online learning and the impact it can have in elevating lives. If you too think you feel similarly and want to help people find the next jump in their careers, there may be a role for you on our growing team. We would love to hear from you.
